# Maze_solving_Wall

This repository contains a package which contains:
1) urdf and gazebo files of the m2wr bot
2) a custom maze
3) and implementation of Right/Left Hand Rule to solve the maze
4) implementation of PID control for the bot to move without much deflection

# The m2wr bot:
This bot has a laser with range -126 to 126 degree
which takes 1008 samples in one second.

# The Research Paper used:
This is added for your refernce for complete knowledge
of the implementation of the algorithm used.
